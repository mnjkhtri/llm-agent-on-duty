An LLM agent is just an LLM with tools.

Usual stuff:
```
python3 -venv .env
source .env/bin/activate
python3 -r requirements.txt
```

Current arsenal of tools include:
- Addition
- Multiplication
- A Comedian

To add:
- Leetcode solver

An agent that tells funny joke is in place currently:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY='<YOUR-KEY-HERE>' python3 main.py
```
